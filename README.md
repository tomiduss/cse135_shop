We have a postgresql database that is included in the file db_backup. 
Username and password for the database are hardcoded so this might be a difficulty on other computers.
We have created jsp-files for the different pages and a menu-file that is included in every file. The menu file
will only show the relevant options, logged in or not logged in, customer or owner.
